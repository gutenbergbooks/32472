A BALANCED DIET</h2>

<p>There is no doubt that under the conditions existing
before the war the American people lived in a higher
degree of comfort than that enjoyed in Europe. Hard
times in America have always been better times than
the best times in Europe. As a student in Munich in
1890 I remember paying three dollars a month for my
room, five cents daily for my breakfast, consisting of
coffee and a roll without butter, and thirty-five cents
for a four-course dinner at a fashionable restaurant.
This does not sound extravagant, but it represents
luxury when compared with the diet of the poorest
Italian peasants of southern Italy. Two Italian scientists
describe how this class of people live mainly on
cornmeal, olive oil, and green stuffs and have done
so for generations. There is no milk, cheese, or eggs
in their dietary. Meat in the form of fat pork is taken
three or four times a year. Cornmeal is taken as
"polenta," or is mixed with beans and oil, or is made
into corn bread. Cabbage or the leaves of beets are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
boiled in water and then eaten with oil flavored with
garlic or Spanish pepper. One of the families investigated
consisted of eight individuals, of whom two were
children. The annual income was 424 francs, or $84.
Of this, three cents per day per adult was spent for food
and the remaining three-fifths of a cent was spent for
other purposes. Little wonder that such people have
migrated to America, but it may strike some as astonishing
that a race so nourished should have become the
man power in the construction of our railways, our
subways, and our great buildings.</p>

<p>Dr. McCollum will tell you that the secret of it all
lies in the green leaves. The quality of the protein in
corn is poor, but the protein in the leaves supplements
that of corn, so that a good result is obtained. Olive
oil when taken alone is a poor fat in a nutritive sense,
but when taken with green leaves, these furnish that
one of the peculiar accessory substances, commonly
known as vitamines, which is present most abundantly
in butter-fat, and gives to butter-fat and to the fat in
whole milk its dominant nutritive value. The green
leaves likewise furnish another accessory substance,
also present in milk, a substance which is soluble in
water and which is necessary for normal life. Furthermore,
the green leaves contain mineral matter in considerable
quantity and in about the same proportions
as they exist in milk.</p>

<p>Here then is the message of economy in diet, corn the
cheapest of all the cereals, a vegetable oil cheaper by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
far than animal fat, which two materials taken together
would bring disaster upon the human race, but if taken
with the addition of cabbage or beet-tops they become
capable of maintaining mankind from generation to
generation. One can safely refer to such a diet as a
balanced diet. Just as in the case of the modern
experimental biological analysis of a balanced ration
in which such a ration is given to rats and its efficiency
as a diet is tested by its capacity to support normal
growth and reproduction of the species, so here the
experimental evidence is presented that corn and olive
oil may become a sustaining diet when green leaves
are a supplementary factor.</p>

<p>This preliminary sketch shows several important
fundamentals of food and nutrition. If one gives an
animal a mixture of purified food-stuffs, pure protein,
pure starch, purified fat, and a mixture of salts like the
salts of milk, the animal will surely die. But if one
substitutes butter-fat for purified fat, and adds a water
solution of the natural salts of milk, the animal lives
and thrives.</p>

<p>Again, the illustration shows how corn may be so
supplemented with other food-stuffs as to become
extremely valuable in nutrition. It is especially
valuable at the present time because corn is comparatively
cheap and plentiful. But one asks how
about pellagra? It must be here definitely stated that
the use of cornmeal is not the cause of pellagra, provided
the right kind of other foods be taken with it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Pellagra occurs in the "corn belt" of the United States,
and especially among the poorer classes in the south.
The disease has developed since the introduction in
1880 of highly perfected milling machinery which
furnishes corn and wheat completely freed from their
outer coverings. In Italy, where the milling of corn is
still primitive, pellagra is not so severe as with us,
because the corn offal is not completely removed and
this contains the accessory food substances or vitamines
which are essential to life. Pellagra is generally
believed to be produced by a too exclusive use of
highly milled corn and wheat flour in association with
salt meats and canned goods, all of which are deficient
in vitamines. The administration of fresh milk is
naturally indicated. Goldberger states that after the
addition of milk to the diet of a pellagrin, the typical
clinical picture of pellagra no longer persists. The
poor in the mill towns of the South lived too exclusively
upon a corn diet without admixture of milk or fresh
animal food or even of cabbage, and pellagra has been
the consequence.</p>

<p>The Food Administrator asks us to eat corn bread
and save the wheat for export. It is a very small
sacrifice to eat corn bread at one meal or more a day.
Indian corn saved our New England ancestors from
starvation, and we can in part substitute it for our
wheat and send the latter abroad to spare others from
starvation. The simplest elements of patriotism demand
that we do this. Therefore let us cry, "Eat corn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
bread and save the wheat for France, the home of Lafayette!"</p>

<p>The United States Department of Agriculture has
estimated that only 6.6 per cent. of our corn crop is
used for human food, and of this, 3.4 per cent. is consumed
by the farmers and their families.</p>

<p>The substitution of foods is no new thing. We find
that an English contemporary author thus described
the food habits of the English people during the
"golden days of Good Queen Bess," three hundred and
fifty years ago:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The gentilitie commonly provide themselves sufficiently of
wheat for their own tables, whylest their household and poore
neighbours in some shires are forced to content themselves with
rye or barleie; yea and in time of dearth many with bread made
eyther of beanes, peason<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> or otes, or of altogether and some
acornes among."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A difference between those days and ours is that the
"gentilitie" and the "poore neighbours" are now
asked to unite in reducing the consumption of wheat
and to do this for the safety and welfare of all mankind.</p>

<p>Another point in war economy is the use of whole
milk in greater quantity, and the diminution of the use
of butter and cream. Cream is bought only by the
wealthy, but in sufficient volume to largely reduce the
amount of whole milk available. In Germany before
the war 15 per cent. of the milk supply of that country
was used for the production of cream. The consequent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
restriction of the milk supply was distinctly to the
detriment of the health of the peasant farmers of
Bavaria. Regarding the use of butter, a Swiss professor,
himself an expert in nutrition, complains that
whereas in his youth children were never given butter
on their bread for breakfast, not even when there was
no jam in the house, yet to-day absence of butter from
the table is held to be indicative of direst poverty.</p>

<p>If one takes a pint of whole milk daily, or even, as we
have seen, cabbage or beet-tops in its stead, one may
take fat in the forms of olive oil or cottonseed oil,
corn oil, cocoanut oil, peanut butter, or in other vegetable
oils, without possible prejudice to health.</p>

<p>Osborne and Mendel, and more recently Halliburton,
have pointed out that oleomargarine as prepared from
beef-fat contains the fat-soluble growth-promoting
accessory substance or vitamine which is present in
butter-fat, but which is not contained in vegetable
oils or in lard.</p>

<p>Halliburton and Drummond summarize the practical
results of their work as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But when we approach the subject of the dietary of the poorer
classes, the question is a more serious one. In ordinary times the
consumption of beef dripping, which is considerable among the
poor, would to a large extent supply the lacking properties of a
vegetable-oil margarine. But at the present time beef itself is
expensive, and the opportunities of obtaining dripping are therefore
minimized. At the same time the three important foods for
children already enumerated (milk, butter, eggs) have risen in
cost, so as to be almost prohibitive to those with slender incomes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
The vegetable-oil margarines still remain comparatively cheap,
and the danger is that unless measures are taken to insure a proper
milk supply for infants at a reasonable charge, these infants may
run the risk of being fed, so far as fat is concerned, entirely upon
an inferior brand of margarine, destitute of the growth-promoting
accessory substance. It would be truer economy even for the
poor to purchase smaller quantities of an oleo-oil margarine if
they cannot afford the luxury of real butter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The legal restrictions placed upon the sale of oleomargarine
and the taxes enhancing its cost, now in
operation in many of our states, are without warrant
in morals or common sense and should be entirely
abolished in times like these. A well-made brand of
oleomargarine is much more palatable than butter of
the second grade, and certainly for cooking purposes
is just as valuable.</p>

<p>Whole milk contains everything necessary for growth
and maintenance, protein, fat, milk-sugar, salts, water,
and the unknown but invaluable accessory substances.
It is of such prime importance that each family should
have this admirable food that I have suggested that
no family of five should ever buy meat until they have
bought three quarts of milk. The insistence by scientific
men upon the prime importance of milk has
probably had something to do with its rapid enhancement
in price. This latter factor is greatly to be
regretted. I have often wondered why it was that a
quart bottle of a fancy brand of milk in New York
should cost about as much as a quart of <i>vin ordinaire</i>
on the streets of Paris, and a quart bottle of cream as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
much as a quart of good champagne in Paris. Despite
much denial it appears to me that milk is not sold as
cheaply as it ought to be. Everything should be done
to conserve our herds of cows for the increased supply
of whole milk and incidentally for the manufacture of
cheese and of milk powder or of condensed milk.</p>

<p>If one takes milk with other foods, meat may be
dispensed with. Thus Hindhede advocates as ideal a
diet consisting of bread, potatoes, fruit, and a pint of
milk. Splendid health, both of body and mind, the
peasants' comparative immunity to indigestion, kidney
and liver disease, as well as an absolute immunity to
gout, is the alluring prospect held out by the following
dietary:</p>

<table cellspacing="2" summary="">
<tr><td>Graham bread</td>      <td>1 pound</td></tr>
<tr><td>Potatoes</td>          <td>2 pounds</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pad-r4">Vegetable fat</td>     <td>½ pound</td></tr>
<tr><td>Apples</td>            <td>1½ pounds</td></tr>
<tr><td>Milk</td>              <td>1 pint</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This bread-potato-fruit diet gives a very excellent
basis of wholesome nutrition. The potatoes yield an
alkaline ash which has a highly solvent power over uric
acid, and, therefore, a good supply of these valuable
tubers is needed by the nation.</p>

<p>To most Americans the dietary factors here described
will appear to be merely attenuated hypotheses,
fit only for philosophic contemplation. For, in real
life, it is the roast beef of Old England, or some other
famed equivalent, that makes its appeal. Far be it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
from me to disparage the feast following a hunt of the
wild boar or other feasts famed in song and story, but
that is not the question. The question is, is meat
necessary? The description of the Italian dietary
answers this in the negative.</p>

<p>But is meat desirable? The Italian experimenters
believed that the addition of four or eight ounces of
meat to the dietaries of some of their subjects increased
their physical and also their mental powers. The
increase in mental power due to change in diet has
always seemed to me to be a figment of the imagination
and not susceptible of demonstration. Thomas lived
for twenty-four days on a diet of starch and cream,
during four days of which time the very small quantity
of three ounces of meat was taken daily, and he found
his mental and muscular power unchanged.</p>

<p>A remarkable experiment on the effect of a potato
diet has been reported by Hindhede. An individual
partook of a diet of between four and one-half and
nine pounds of potatoes daily, with some vegetable
margarine, during a period of nearly three hundred
days. The rule was to eat only when hungry and then
the potatoes could be taken at the rate of an ounce a
minute. During the last three months (ninety-five
days) of the experiment severe mechanical work was
performed and the total food intake for the latter
period amounted to 770 pounds of potatoes and 48
pounds of margarine. What could be more simple
than stocking the cellar with coal, potatoes, and a tub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of margarine! Who then would worry about the complexities
of modern life?</p>

<p>Of course, vegetarianism is no new thing. Its principal
exponent was Sylvester Graham. It so happens
that he was the brother of my great grandmother, and
of him my father wrote in 1861, "long lanky Sylvester
Vegetable Graham, leanest of men." Graham in
1829 began the advocacy of moderation in the use of
a diet consisting of vegetables, Graham bread, fruits,
nuts, salts and pure water, and excluding meat, sauces,
salads, tea, coffee, alcohol, pepper, and mustard. The
first effect of this diet, which largely eliminated the
flavors, was to reduce the weight through lowering the
intake of food, but the health of many followers of the
diet appears to have been benefited. The "Graham
System" of dieting suffered from withering criticism
at the time. He published in 1837 a little book entitled,
"Bread and Bread Making," bearing on its
cover the scriptural quotation "Bread strengtheneth
man's heart." He says in this volume:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But while the people of our country are entirely given up as they
are at present, to gross and promiscuous feeding on the dead carcasses
of animals and to the untiring pursuit of wealth, it is perhaps
wholly vain for a single individual to raise his voice on a subject
of this kind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The well-known work of Chittenden has shown that
when the protein intake is reduced by one half or less
of that which the average American appetite suggests,
professional men, soldiers and athletes may be maintained
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>in the best physical condition. One of Yale's
champion intercollegiate athletes won all the events
of the year in which he was entered while living on a
reduced protein or Chittenden diet. Upon such a
diet, or less than that, the people of Germany are now
living to-day. The principle involves eating meat
very sparingly, taking half a piece where one would
have formerly been taken, and using it only for its
flavor. The wing of a chicken has little meat on it
and yet if eaten together with vegetables it gives the
meal a different quality than it would have had without
it, and to this extent its use is warranted. The
muscles are active when hard labor is done, but the
muscles do not need meat for the performance of their
work. A fasting man may have considerable power.
The popular idea of the necessity of meat for a laboring
man may be epitomized in the statement: a strong
man can eat more meat than a weak one, hence meat
makes a man strong. The proposition is evidently
absurd.</p>

<p>Not only is the taking of meat without beneficial
relation to the capacity for muscular work, but, in fact,
an exclusive meat diet results in the sensation that work
is being accomplished with difficulty. When meat is
metabolized it stimulates the body to a higher heat
production, as great an increase as 55 per cent. having
been observed in a resting man. No other food-stuff
will accomplish so great an increase. It is especially
worthy of note that this increase in the heat production,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
due to the <i>specific dynamic action</i> of protein, as it is
called, cannot be utilized in the execution of mechanical
work. When the organism of a laborer at work in a
hot environment is called upon to eliminate extra heat,
due to the work he is performing, he must also eliminate
the quota of heat which is derived from any large
ingestion of meat. Hence, the American farmer in
the hot weather can eat little meat.</p>

<p>So far as is known, taking meat even in large excess
is not harmful, but it represents luxury and waste.
According to an oral statement by A. E. Taylor, the
results of many thousand urinary analyses in Germany
during the second year of the war showed about 7 grams
of nitrogen excreted, which would correspond to a
dietary containing about 45 grams of protein. As a
matter of fact, this is the equivalent of the reduced
protein dietary of Chittenden, and it is reported that
no ill effects can be attributed to it. The flavor of
meat is such that it lends itself to the easy preparation
of a palatable meal, but this flavor could undoubtedly
be as well obtained if the present consumption of meat
were cut in two. It is a question of habit, but with the
present reduced supply of meat one must adopt new
habits. It would be highly desirable if the grain now
fed to fatten beef were given to maintain herds of
milch cows.</p>

<p>Indulgence in meat is due to the desire for strong
flavor. With the increased distribution of wealth, the
demand for meat grows. Its consumption by all classes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
had vastly increased in all prosperous countries prior
to the war. It is well, however, to remember that its
use has been excessive and unnecessary, and its price
can be cut by wholesale voluntary abstinence. The
British people have suffered no hardship in the recent
reduction of their meat ration.</p>

<p>A British Commission has reported to Parliament
that it takes three times as much fodder to produce
beef as it does to produce milk or pork of the same food
value. Since cows eat chiefly hay and grass and pigs
eat grain the cost of the production of a unit value of
milk is much less than the cost of the same value in
the form of pork. It takes only fifty per cent. more
fodder to produce veal than to produce pork. Milk,
pork, and veal have long been the established protein-containing
foods of nations on the continent of Europe.
According to these figures beef should cost in the market
twice what veal costs, and yet the butcher charges
nearly the same for the two. It would save food for
milk production if steers were eaten as veal and not
fed up into beef cattle. A suitable tax on all steers
over a year old would accomplish this result. If all
heifers were developed into milch cows and no cow
capable of giving milk in quantity were slaughtered,
the country would be placed on a much better basis
than at present. It might make beef expensive, but
there is every reason why it should be expensive. It
would increase the dairy business, which is evidently a
need of the times, something for the protection of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
welfare of mankind. For it must be remembered that
a well-nourished cow during a single year will give in
the form of milk as much protein and two and a half
times the number of calories as are contained in her
own body.</p>

<p>This was written before the publication of the following
words of Armsby, the foremost authority on animal
nutrition:<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Roast pig, to those who like it, is not only a delicacy but a
valuable article of diet, but nevertheless, it is possible to pay too
high a price for it, and while a proposal to restrict rather than to
promote meat production in the present crisis may appear both
irrational and unpatriotic it may nevertheless be in the interest
of true food economy....</p>

<p>It may be roughly estimated that about 24 per cent. of the
energy of grain is recovered for human consumption in pork, about
18 per cent. in milk and only about 3.5 per cent. in beef and mutton.
In other words, the farmer who feeds bread grains to his
stock is burning up 75 to 97 per cent. of them in order to produce
for us a small residue of roast pig, and so is diminishing the total
stock of human food....</p>

<p>The task of the stock feeder must be to utilize through his skill
and knowledge the inedible products of the farm and factory, such
as hay, corn stalks, straw, bran, brewers' and distillers' grains,
gluten feed, and the like, and to make at least a fraction of them
available for man's use. In so doing he will be really adding to the
food supply and will be rendering a great public service. Rather
than seek to stimulate live stock husbandry the ideal should be to
adjust it to the limits set by the available supply of forage crops
and by-product feeding stuffs while, on the other hand, utilizing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
these to the greatest practicable extent, because in this way we
save some of what would otherwise be a total loss....</p>

<p>The hog is the great competitor of man for the higher grades of
food, and in swine husbandry as ordinarily conducted we are in
danger of paying too much for our roast pig. Cattle and sheep,
on the other hand, although less efficient as converters, can utilize
products which man can not use and save some of their potential
value as human food. From this point of view, as well as on account
of the importance of milk to infants and invalids, the high
economy of food production by the dairy cow deserves careful
consideration, although of course the large labor requirement is a
counterbalancing factor.</p>

<p>At any rate, it is clear that at the present time enthusiastic
but ill-considered "booming" of live stock production may do
more harm than good. If it is desirable to restrict or prohibit the
production of alcohol from grain or potatoes on the ground that it
involves a waste of food value, the same reason calls for restriction
of the burning-up of these materials to produce roast pig. This
means, of course, a limited meat supply. To some of us this may
seem a hardship. Meat, however, is by no means the essential
that we have been wont to suppose and partial deprivation of it
is not inconsistent with high bodily efficiency. Certainly no
patriotic citizen would wish to insist on his customary allowance
of roast pig at the cost of the food supply of his brothers in the
trenches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The United States Department of Agriculture has
estimated that a pig that has reached the weight of
150 pounds should be slaughtered, because beyond
that weight the cost of the quantity of feed required
to maintain the animal is out of proportion to the
gain in food value of the pig. One might, therefore,
call a pig weighing 150 pounds a <i>maximal economic
hog</i>.</p>

<h2>II<br /><br />
CALORIES IN COMMON LIFE</h2>

<p>A person is properly nourished who receives adequate
energy in the form of carbohydrate and fat (and incidentally
protein); adequate material for repair of
wornout parts, such as protein and mineral salts; and
the diet must contain certain accessory food substances
known as food hormones or "vitamins." Also, it
must contain water. But this is not all, for the food
offered must be acceptable to the palate of the individual.
A member of the French Scientific Commission
which visited the United States in the summer of 1917,
when questioned regarding the use of corn bread in
France, replied "on ne peut pas changer des habitudes."
The proper nutrition of an individual depends, therefore,
not only upon a sufficient supply of food from a
mechanistic standpoint, but also upon the reasonable
satisfaction of the sense of appetite. These dual fundamentals
of proper nutrition should be ever borne in mind.</p>

<p>Heat from the sun enters into the composition of the
food substances when they are being built up in the
plants, and this energy, which is latent in the food, is
set free in the animal body and is used as the source of
power behind all the physical activities of the body.
The energy can all be recovered as heat and measured
in the form of calories. According to the principles of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the law of the conservation of energy, heat is not destructible.
The understanding of the value of a calorie
is indispensable for the comprehension of nutrition. A
calorie is the measure of a unit of heat, or the quantity
of heat necessary to raise a liter of water from 0° to 1°
Centigrade. Apparatus has been invented for measuring
the heat production of a man, an apparatus which
is called a calorimeter or a measurer of calories. If one
puts a man weighing, say, 156 pounds in the box of
such an apparatus, so that he lies comfortably on a bed
in complete muscular relaxation, and before his breakfast,
one finds that he produces 70 calories an hour.
Only in certain types of disease is there any variation
from this normal, though of course the weight of the
man makes a difference in his requirement for energy.
If, at the same time the subject is in the box, the quantity
of oxygen which he absorbs is measured and if certain
other chemical analyses be carried out, one can
calculate the exact amounts of protein, fat, and sugar
which have been oxidized by this oxygen. Now, if one
calculates how much heat ought to have been set free
from the oxidation of these quantities of protein fat and
carbohydrate, it is discovered that the heat which
ought to have been produced is exactly that quantity
which was measured as having been produced by the
man. This measurement represents the <i>basal metabolism</i>
of a man at complete rest, when his oxidative activities
are at their lowest ebb.</p>

<p>The basal metabolism as measured by 70 calories per
hour in the case of this individual represents the sum of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the fuel needed&mdash;(1) to maintain the beating of the
heart, which every minute of a man's life moves the
blood or one-twentieth part of the weight of the body, in
a circle through the blood-vessels; (2) to maintain the
muscles of respiration that the blood may be purified in
the lungs; (3) to maintain the body temperature at
that constant level which is so characteristic that a
slight variation signifies illness, and (4) to maintain in
the living state the numerous tissues of the body. Any
extraneous muscular movements are carried out in virtue
of an increased oxidation of materials and the heat
production rises above the level of the basal metabolism
with increased muscular effort. For a long time
the power for the maintenance of the human machine
can be furnished by its own body fat, as is seen in cases
of prolonged fasting, but usually the power is derived
instead from the food-fuel which is taken. The great
question in the world to-day is whether or not a sufficient
quantity of food-fuel is available to support the
human family. The question of calories is not an
academic one, but an intensely practical one.</p>

<p>Science strives to express itself in mathematic terms,
and this paper is written with that end in view.</p>

<p>Phenomena of life are phenomena of motion. These
motions are maintained at the expense of chemical
energy liberated in the oxidative breakdown of carbohydrate,
fat, and protein. Furthermore, the protein
structure of the body cells and the salts of the bones and
other tissues are in a constant state of wearing down.
The energy for the human machine and the materials<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
for its self-repair are taken in the form of food. The
general term <i>metabolism</i> includes all the chemical activities
which take place under the influence of living cells.</p>

<p>The total quantity of heat produced by the body is a
measure of the intensity of the oxidation of carbohydrate,
fat, and protein within the body.</p>

<p>It is important to know definitely whether there is
any constant measure of the level of the basal metabolism
in normal people, so that one may determine in
cases of disease whether the heat production is normal
or increased or decreased.</p>

<p>Rubner discovered that the heat production of mammalia
during rest was the same per square meter of surface
whether the being was a horse, a man, a dog, or a
mouse. The proposition has appeared so improbable
as to call forth much antagonism. DuBois deserves
the credit of having established this relationship for
man beyond the possibility of a doubt. He was able
to do this on account of his discovery of a new and accurate
method of measuring the area of the body surface.
It appears from his work that the <i>basal metabolism</i>
for men between twenty and fifty years old is approximately
40 calories per hour per square meter of
body surface, within a ± error of 10 per cent.</p>

<p>Boothby has found that the metabolism of patients
who have recovered their health after hospital operations
and who have been confined in the hospital between
twenty and fifty days does not vary from the
normal standard of DuBois.</p>

<p>It has been found by DuBois that the basal metabolism
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>in boys of twelve is 25 per cent. higher than for an
adult of the same height and weight, or <b>50</b> calories per
square meter of body surface; and that in boys of fifteen
the metabolism is 11 per cent. higher than for the
adult of the same size and shape, or <b>44</b> calories per square
meter of body surface (unpublished work of DuBois).
These results explain the large appetites of boys.</p>

<p>Women show a metabolism which is 7 per cent. lower
than that of men, or <b>37</b> calories per hour per square
meter of surface.</p>

<p>From the charts of the average heights and weights
of men varying between fifteen and fifty-five years old,
given by American life insurance companies, Mr. H. V.
Atkinson, of my laboratory, has calculated the basal
metabolism in a table here presented. Unfortunately,
the weights given in these statistics include clothes
worn by the individuals. The calculated heat production,
however, is in each case based upon the weight
without clothes. The table is computed from the following
values:</p>

<p>The basal metabolism of an average boy of thirteen
years of age weighing 80 pounds and of a height of 4
feet, 10 inches, may be calculated as 1525 calories per
day. This is the same as that of a man twenty-five
years old, weighing 126 pounds and 5 feet, 2 inches tall.</p>

<p>A boy thirteen years old and weighing 156 pounds,
his height being 6 feet, 1 inch (there are such cases),
would have a basal metabolism of 2300 calories, or
larger than that of any grown man given in the table&mdash;larger
than a man weighing 211 pounds and 6 feet, 4
inches in height. I personally know a boy of this age
and size. His parents are said to have sent him to
boarding school in order to reduce their food bills.</p>

<p>It is evident from this discussion that the food requirement
of boys over twelve years old is about the
same as that of men. The emaciation of the children
of the poor probably reduces their requirement of food.
It is not generally recognized that the boy needs as
much food as his father. The requirements of girls
have not been investigated, but they probably need as
much as their mothers.</p>

<p>These data will give with close scientific precision the
<i>minimal requirement for energy</i> which is necessary for
the maintenance of the bed-ridden.</p>

<p>Ordinary life, however, is not constituted after this
fashion. "By the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat
bread."</p>

<p>From the work of F. G. Benedict one may calculate
the increase in the basal metabolism, as follows:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<table cellspacing="2" summary="">

<tr><td>Standing, leaning on support</td><td align='right' class="pad-r2">3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Standing, "attention"</td><td align='right' class="pad-r2">14</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If one wishes to determine from the basal metabolism
table the heat production of a person who is confined
to his room, one should add to the metabolism of the
twenty-four hours the increase above the basal for
those hours of the day during which he is sitting in a
chair or standing.</p>

<p>Passing to a consideration of the subject of mechanical
work done by a man, one finds that it requires about
1.1 calories to transport a pound of body weight three
miles during an hour, and that increasing power must
be generated if the speed is increased above this rate of
<i>maximal economic velocity</i>.</p>

<p>These relations are shown below:</p>

<table cellspacing="2" summary="">

<p>If one wishes to determine the heat production of a
man weighing 156 pounds and 5 feet, 7 inches in height,
and who is walking or running, the following calculations
can be made:</p>

<p>If the man's food cost 10 cents a thousand calories,
it may be calculated that he would have to walk over
eight miles at a rate of three miles per hour in order to
save money when he pays a 5-cent carfare. (This,
however, does not include the cost of shoe leather.)</p>

<p>The carrying of a load of 44 pounds is done at the
same expenditure of energy as the carrying of one's own
body weight when the rate is three miles an hour, so
the soldier's equipment would call for the added expenditure
of 48 calories (44 × 1.1), making his total
hourly expenditure of energy nearly 300 calories (249 + 44)
during a hike on a level road. His daily requirement
for energy might be:</p>

<table cellspacing="2" summary="">
<tr><td></td><th>Calories</th></tr>

<p>This would be the heat production of a soldier on a
day of a "forced march." The ordinary day's march is
only fifteen miles.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p><p>This assumes a level road. If, however, there are
hills to climb and the body weight and the pack are
lifted 1000 feet during the hike, this is done at the additional
expense of approximately 0.96 calory of energy
per pound of weight lifted. If the man weighed 156
pounds and the pack 44 pounds, the additional fuel requirement
would be 192 calories (200 × 0.96). The
total energy requirement for this kind of a hike would
have been 4200 calories. Walking down hill is accomplished
at an expenditure of slightly less energy than
walking on the level, but this factor need not concern
one.</p>

<p>Supposing, however, this individual were running,
lightly clad, on a level road in a race for a distance of 40
miles at the rate of 5.3 miles per hour, he would complete
the distance in seven hours and thirty-three minutes,
which is a reasonable record. His metabolism
might thus be calculated:</p>

<p>It is a matter of record that a man has run between
Milwaukee and Chicago, a distance of 80 miles, in about
fifteen hours. Such an amount of work would have required
over 9000 calories for the day.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p><p>These calculations are all based upon experimental
results obtained in various laboratories in different
parts of the world and can be accepted as being free
from any gross error.</p>

<p>It is evident that the energy requirement is proportional
to the amount of mechanical energy expended.</p>

<p>One may turn now to the fuel needs in terms of calories
in certain industrial pursuits. According to
Becker and Hämäläinen, the quantity of extra metabolism
per hour required in various pursuits is as follows:</p>

wakefulness when the person is sitting or standing, and
then multiply the factors in the last table by the numbers

<p>The data here given are inadequate to cover the industrial
situation, but they show clearly that heavy work
cannot be accomplished without a sufficient amount
of food-fuel.</p>

<p>The food-fuel with which to accomplish work is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
necessary not only for the soldier, but for the workman
behind the line, and it should be adequate in quantity,
satisfactory in quality, and not exorbitant in cost.</p>

<p>In virtue of the world-wide scarcity of food, the work
of the individual should be worthy of the food which he
eats.</p>

<p>Tables showing the cost of various wholesome food-stuffs
about July 1, 1917, are here reproduced for the
benefit of the reader. The tables were prepared by
Dr. F. C. Gephart and issued by the Department of
Health of the City of New York in a leaflet edited by
Doctors Holt, La Fetra, Pisek, and Lusk on the subject
of food for children. If the world is seeking after energy
in the form of food-fuel, the world is rightly entitled
to understand the value of its purchases. It
must be clearly understood that people are always destined
to look with hopeful anticipation toward the enjoyment
of a meal. They will instinctively "eat calories"
just as they instinctively "eat pounds." They
<i>buy pounds</i> of food, and they could buy more intelligently
if they knew the energy value of what they buy.</p>

<p>A British scientific commission has reported to Parliament
that if the workman be undernourished he may,
by grit and pluck, continue his labor for a certain time,
but in the end his work is sure to fail. It makes no
difference what the nutritive condition of the person is,
if a certain job involving muscular effort is to be done it
always requires a definite amount of extra food-fuel
to do it. Rubner, the greatest German authority on
nutrition, excited grossly inappropriate hilarity in the
comic press of his country by showing that a poor
woman who waited several hours in line in order to receive
the dole of fat allowed her by the government
actually consumed more of her own body fat in the
effort of standing during those hours than she obtained
in the fat given her when her turn to receive it came at
last.</p>

<p>A method by which food-fuel can readily be saved
with benefit to the nation and to the individual is for
the overfat to reduce their weight. This has been done
with drastic severity in Germany. I have heard from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
unquestioned sources how a man who had weighed 240
pounds lost 90 pounds since the war began; how a corpulent
professor at Breslau lost greatly in weight, but
during the second summer of the war regained his
former corpulence during a sojourn in the Bavarian
Tyrol, a joy not now tolerated; and how an American
woman lost 40 pounds in weight last winter in Dresden.
There is every reason why a man who is overweight at
the age of fifty should reduce his weight until he reaches
the weight he was when he was thirty-five. According
to Dr. Fisk he is a better insurance risk if after thirty-five
he is under the weight which is the average for
those of his years. Reduction in weight reduces the
basal requirement for food, and reduces the amount of
fuel needed for moving the body in walking. The most
extreme illustration of the effect of emaciation upon the
food requirement is afforded by a woman who after
losing nearly half of her body weight was found to need
only 40 per cent. of the food-fuel formerly required.
This represented a state not far from the border line of
death from starvation, but it indicates how a community
may long support itself on restricted rations. It
must be strictly borne in mind, however, that if any external
muscular work is to be accomplished it can only
be effected at the expense of a given added quantity of
food-fuel, whether the person be fat or thin.</p>

<p>It is not at all difficult to reduce the body weight.
Suppose a clergyman or a physician requires 2500 calories
daily in the accomplishment of his work and takes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
2580 calories per day instead. The additional 80
calories is the equivalent of a butter ball weighing a
third of an ounce, or an ounce of bread or half a glass of
milk. It would seem to be the height of absurdity to
object to such a trifle. But if this excess in food intake
be continued for a year, the person will gain nine
pounds and at the end of ten years ninety pounds.
Such a person would find that he required a constantly
increasing amount of food in order to transport his constantly
increasing weight. In instances of this sort a
motto may be applied which I heard the last time I was
in Washington: "Do not stuff your husband, husband
your stuff."</p>

<p>Now it is evident that, if instead of taking more than
the required amount of food a little less be taken than is
needed, the balance of food-fuel must be obtained from
the reserves of the body's own supply of fat. By cutting
down the quantity of fat taken, or by eliminating a
glass of beer or a drink of whiskey, and not compensating
for the loss of these by adding other food stuffs,
the weight may be gradually reduced. The amusing
little book entitled "Eat and Grow Thin" recommends
a high protein and almost carbohydrate-free diet for
the accomplishment of this purpose, but its advice has
made so many of my friends so utterly miserable that
I am sure in the end it will counteract its own message.</p>

<p>The work of the world is accomplished in largest part
by the oxidation of carbohydrates, that is to say, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
sugars and starches. Bread, corn, rice, macaroni,
cane-sugar, these are <i>par excellence</i> the food-fuels of
the human machine. In the dinner-pail of the laborer
they testify as to the source of his power. They are
convertible into glucose in the body, which glucose
gives power to the human machine. They may be used
for the production of work without of themselves increasing
the heat production of the worker, as happens
after meat ingestion. (<a href="#Page_18">See p. 18.</a>) Fat also may be
used as a source of energy, but unless carbohydrate is
present a person can not work up to his fullest capacity.</p>

<p>Cane-sugar is a valuable condiment, and when taken
in small quantities every half hour, may delay the onset
of fatigue. It is more largely used in the United States
than in other countries in the world. As a substitute,
glucose may be used. This is found in grapes and in
raisins and it is also produced in large quantities by the
hydrolysis of starch and sold under the commercial
name of corn syrup or Karo. This substance is entirely
wholesome and may be freely employed in the
place of sugar, which is scarce.</p>

<p>As to the use of alcoholic beverages, the question resolves
itself into several factors. Alcohol gives a sham
sensation of added force and in reality decreases the
ability to do work. Alcohol is the greatest cause of
misery in the world, and as Cushny has put it, if alcohol
had been a new synthetic drug introduced from Germany,
its importation would long since have been forbidden.
On the other hand, good beer makes poor food<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
taste well. It also frequently leads to overeating.
The cure for bad food is to have our daughters taught
how to cook a decent meal. After that we can talk
about prohibition.</p>

<p>In some parts of the world whole nations are starving
to death. In most countries of the world people are
short of food. In America we have more food than in
any other land, and we must, therefore, be careful in our
abundance, saving it to the utmost, while, at the same
time, conserving the safety of our own people.</p>

<h2>III<br /><br />
RULES OF SAVING AND SAFETY</h2>

<p>1. Let no family (of five persons) buy meat until it
has bought three quarts of milk, the cheapest protein
food. Farmers should be urged to meet this demand.</p>

<p>2. Save the cream and butter and eat oleomargarine
and vegetable oils. Olive oil or cottonseed oil, taken
with cabbage, lettuce, or beet-tops, is excellent food, in
many ways imitating milk.</p>

<p>3. Eat meat sparingly, rich and poor, laborer and
indolent alike. Meat does not increase the muscular
power. When a person is exposed to great cold, meat
may be recommended, for it warms the body more than
any other food. In hot weather, for the same reason, it
causes increased sweating and discomfort. In general,
twice as much meat is used as is now right, for to produce
meat requires much fodder which might better be
used for milk production.</p>

<p>4. Eat corn bread. It saved our New England ancestors
from starvation. If we eat it we can send wheat
to France. Eat oatmeal.</p>

<p>5. Drink no alcohol. In many families 10 per cent.
of the income is spent for drink, or a sum which, if
spent for real food, would greatly improve the welfare
of the family.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p><p>6. Eat corn syrup on cereals. It will save the sugar.
Eat raisins in rice pudding, for raisins contain sugar.</p>

<p>7. Eat fresh fish.</p>

<p>8. Eat fruit and vegetables.</p>

<p>Since the total energy for the maintenance of our
bodies can be measured in calories, and since this energy
serves for the maintenance of the nations of the
world, is it not surprising how little even educated
people know about the subject?</p>
